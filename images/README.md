## Objective
These challenges will help educate the community on Level 100/300 items related to MDW.  The goal will be to build out an overall reference architecture, hands-on labs, load patterns and data flow diagram to help developers get started.

## DataSet 
For us to get started, we’ve identified the Worldwide Importers as our OLTP and DW data sets.  For each use case, we will integrate this data into the WWI data set.  Here are the other data sets for each track.


	1. Structured WWI -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/wide-world-importers-what-is?view=sql-server-2017
	
	2. Data Lake Integration -- Exported BCP files from lab one will be staged in Data Lake
	
	3. Data Pipeline Migration --  DailyETL.ispac files from WWI sample database
	
	4. Realtime Data pipeline -- Data generator to replicate web logs for sales data (TBD)
	
	5. Analytics Migration -- Reuse reports data in WWI Sample database

	6. Mission critical app -- Whiteboard session to build out reference architecture
			
Our goal is to have an end-to-end story that covers all Azure Data Services and explains common patterns so they can learn how to build it themselves.

* Modern Data Warehouse Learning Path to help upskill Data Engineers to build out MDW platforms

* Good reference material to learn key concepts and hands-on labs to get practical experience

* Different labs, github project and What the Hack can be reusable code if required
